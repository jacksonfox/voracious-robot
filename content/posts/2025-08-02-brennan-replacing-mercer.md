Apparently Brennan Lee Mulligan "left" Dimension 20 not to [make shoes](https://brennansamericangirldollshoes.com/), but for a [new gig](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/critical-role-reveals-campaign-game-master-brennan-lee-mulligan-1235398003/) as DM for [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/)'s campaign 4. I've loved Brennan's previous collaborations with Critical Role, excited he's moving into the big seat.
