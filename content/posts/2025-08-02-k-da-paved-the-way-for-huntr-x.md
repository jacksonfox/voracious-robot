title: "K/DA paved the way for HUNTR/X"

I'm obsessed with [HUNTR/X](https://open.spotify.com/track/1CPZ5BxNNd0n0nF4Orb9JS?si=cbeb2d324af54c38), so I was intrigued to learn about [K/DA](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/event/kda-official-fan-club/), a virtual k-pop group created by Riot Games to [promote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K/DA) League of Legends.

> K/DA walked so Huntr/x could run. Damn, Riot really dropped the ball.
